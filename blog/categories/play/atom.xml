    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think one of the main disadvantages of Play's design is the overuse of static methods in controllers. This causes hard to test controllers, long-running tests and decreases modularisation. So, how can we use Spring to rescue us? <!-- more --></p>

<p>First of all, don't get me wrong: I like the Play Framework a lot. I just think there are chances for optimisation if it comes to testing and modularisation.</p>

<p>After searching for Spring integration in Play Framework 2 I discovered this <a href="https://github.com/guillaumebort/play20-spring-demo">demo</a> by Guillaume Bort on how to combine Spring and Play 2. The name of this repository suggests that is does work with Play 2.0 but it only works with Play 2.1 because the so called <em>managed controller classes instantiation</em> is only available on Play 2.1 branch. And in fact with Play 2.1 you can easily integrate every dependency injection framework you want by implementing a <code>getControllerInstance</code> method on a Global object.</p>

<p>I want to show you how to integrate Spring into your Play 2.0.x application.</p>

<p>There is already a Spring module for Play 2. But I don't like the fact that you have to use at least two lines of XML to get annotation-based configuration and component-scanning in place. As Chris Beams states in his slides about modern enterpise app config: <a href="http://cbeams.github.com/modern-config/#89">"this is kind of ironic"</a>. If you like XML files you can also try this module: <a href="https://github.com/wsargent/play-2.0-spring-module">play-2.0-spring-module</a>. I prefer annotation-based configuration. But this module inspired my solution a lot.</p>

<p>Ok, the goal is to autowire our controllers. Therefore, you have to intercept the controller creation by Play in some decent way. The trick is to add a stupid <code>ControllerFactory</code> that delegates static controller calls to non-static controller classes and let all routes go through this factory.</p>

<p>```java ControllerFactory to wrap non-static controllers in static method calls
public class ControllerFactory {</p>

<pre><code>public static Application application() {
    return new Application();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p><code>scala Corresponding routes file for this example
GET     /                           controllers.ControllerFactory.application.index()
GET     /personalized/:name         controllers.ControllerFactory.application.helloTo(name: String)
</code></p>

<p>The controllers can be non-static and therefore also instantiated by an application context. In the next step you simply bootstrap an application context in your Global object.</p>

<p>```java Application context bootstrap during start of Play application
public class Global extends GlobalSettings {</p>

<pre><code>private static ApplicationContext applicationContext;

@Override
public void onStart(Application application) {
    applicationContext = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringConfiguration.class);
}

public static &lt;T&gt; T getBean(Class&lt;T&gt; beanClass) {
    if (applicationContext == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("application context is not initialized");
    }
    return applicationContext.getBean(beanClass);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>With this you get an application context everytime Play starts. In the last step you autowire every controller in the static delegating methods of <code>ControllerFactory</code>.</p>

<p>```java ControllerFactory with autowiring controllers
public class ControllerFactory {</p>

<pre><code>public static Application application() {
    // magic happens: Spring autowires your controller :-)
    return Global.getBean(Application.class);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Now you have fully fledged Spring integration in your Play application and the <code>Application</code> controller can be autowired.</p>

<p>```java Example of autowired Application controller
@Component
public class Application extends Controller {</p>

<pre><code>@Autowired
private HelloWorldService helloWorldService;

@Autowired
private PersonalizedHelloWorldService personalizedHelloWorldService;

public Result index() {
    return ok(helloWorldService.sayHello());
}

public Result helloTo(String name) {
    return ok(personalizedHelloWorldService.sayHelloTo(name));
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

    <link href="http://cupofjava.de/blog/2012/11/09/integration-tests-with-mongodb-and-play-framework-2/"/>

    <id>http://cupofjava.de/blog/2012/11/09/integration-tests-with-mongodb-and-play-framework-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In of my projects I am building a rest api with the playframework 2 (using the java api) and MongoDB as the persistence storage. One of the first question that arises was: how can I implement integration tests properly with a test instance of MongoDB? I wanted to have a known state in MongoDB for each test and it should be easy to set up the test instance. <!-- more --></p>

<p>I looked for projects on github that supports my requirements and came up with these three possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thiloplanz/jmockmongo"><strong>jmockmongo</strong></a> This is a mock implementation of the MongoDB protocol and works purely in-memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lordofthejars/nosql-unit"><strong>nosqlunit</strong></a> This library offers more features than jmockmongo. You can use it to test several nosql stores and configure data sets for your tests. For testing MongoDB it uses jmockmongo under the hood. You can also use a local or remote running MongoDB instance for your tests if the in-memory approach does not suit your needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/embedmongo.flapdoodle.de"><strong>embedmongo</strong></a> With embedmongo you get a platform independent way of running local MongoDB instances. It provides helper classes to bootstrap MongoDB during tests. The most important feature imho: You do not need to install MongoDB. embedmongo downloads MongoDB automatically for windows, linux and mac when bootstraping your tests.</li>
</ul>


<p>Because I wanted a running MongoDB instance and no in-memory solution I finally chose embedmongo. There is a nice helper class which lets you easily setup a MongoDB on a free port of your system. You can also choose the version.</p>

<p><code>java Bootstrap local MongoDB instance with embedmongo
new MongodForTestsFactory().with(Version.V2_2_0).newMongo();
</code></p>

<p>Furthermore I had the needs to integrate the MongoDB test instance into the lifecycle of Play. In Play one typically uses a fake instance for proper integration tests.</p>

<p>``` java Functional test in Play 2 with a fake application
running(fakeApplication(), new Runnable() {</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void run() {
    // here you insert your test code
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>One can intercept the bootstrap of a Play 2 application with a so called Global object that is placed in the default package (or another package that you have configured in the application.conf). There you can override methods that are called from Play during start and shutdown of your application. The perfect place to bootstrap your own MongoDB instance.</p>

<p>``` java Automatically bootstrap of local MongoDB instance in Play 2
import com.mongodb.Mongo;
import de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo.distribution.Version;
import de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo.tests.MongodForTestsFactory;
import play.Application;
import play.GlobalSettings;
import play.Logger;</p>

<p>import java.io.IOException;</p>

<p>public class Global extends GlobalSettings {</p>

<pre><code>private MongodForTestsFactory mongodForTestsFactory;

@Override
public void onStart(Application application) {
    if (application.isProd()) {
        /*
         * here you can setup mongodb for production,
         * e.g. connect to remote mongodb instance
         */
    } else {
        startLocalMongoInstance();
    }
}

@Override
public void onStop(Application application) {
    if (mongodForTestsFactory != null) {
        Logger.info("Shutdown local mongo instance...");
        mongodForTestsFactory.shutdown();
        Logger.info("Local mongo instance was stopped");
    }
}

private void startLocalMongoInstance() {
    Logger.info("Start local mongo instance...");
    try {
        mongodForTestsFactory = new MongodForTestsFactory();
        Mongo mongo = mongodForTestsFactory.with(Version.V2_2_0).newMongo();
        // that's it: now you've got the local mongo instance
        Logger.info("Local mongo instance was successfully started");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        Logger.error("Unable to start local mongo instance", e);
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```
This solution starts a MongoDB instance each time you start Play in development mode and for each test where you start a fake application. In production you typically connect to a remote MongoDB instance or cluster.</p>
