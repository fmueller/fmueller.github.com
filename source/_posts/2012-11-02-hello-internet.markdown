Today I decided spontaneously to start my own blog. Most times I will blog about technology and programming: the things that tackles me. What that could be you may find on the [about me](/about-me) site.

And sorry for the oh so funny title of this first blog post. I did not find a better one. ;-)

So far so good. I hope you will enjoy the content.
