With this post I start a new series in this blog: At every beginning of a new year I wanna do a retroperspective (motivated by Agileâ€¦) of the technical stuff in my life that happens during the last year. Mostly about the stuff I learned. So, here it goes and I hope it does not annoy you too much.<!--more-->
